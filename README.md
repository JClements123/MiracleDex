## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create an interactive website that documents God's miraculous work in history,
inspired by the work of soon-to-be St. Carlo Acutis. This project was assigned for CSCI 270 at Ave Maria 
University under Dr. Trevor Tomesh to work on front-end development skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
JSON.

## Setup Instructions

All of the data that is utilized in this website is from the following JSON file:
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/trevortomesh/7bbf97b2fbae96639ebf1a254b6a7a70/raw/miracles.json.

There are not many specific setup instructions. Simply visit the above live site link,
and the website should appear in your browser!

Take a look around my GitHub repository for all of the source code.

## Known Issues

At this time, there are no major issues that I believe still exist with my project. The mobile layout can sometimes
have some unexpected behaviors where the background kind of shifts up and down as you scroll, and sometimes the 19th
card out of the 20 seems to be in the hover state as you can see in the CSS, but these are very minor issues that could
potentially be completely rooted out in the future even though they pose no significant inconvenience to the user.

With more time, I would love to continue to develop this site, adding new features like filtering based on the
type of miracle you are interested in, adding images for each miracle, and continuing to style the website so
that it reflects God's beauty.

👍Thank you for taking a look at my website! I hope that it has helped you grow spiritually and fostered a devotion
to the saints and led you to marvel at God's work throughout history.
