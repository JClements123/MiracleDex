## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create an interactive website that documents God's miraculous work in history,
inspired by the work of soon-to-be St. Carlo Acutis. This project was assigned for CSCI 270 at Ave Maria 
University under Dr. Trevor Tomesh to work on front-end development skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
JSON.

## Known Issues

At this time, there are not any known issues with my website. I believe that my website design aligns with
the rubric given for this project.

With more time, I would love to continue to develop this site, adding new features like filtering based on the
type of miracle you are interested in, adding images for each miracle, and continuing to style the website so
that it reflects God's beauty.

Thank you for taking a look at my website! I hope that it has helped you grow spiritually and fostered a devotion
to the saints and led you to marvel at God's work throughout history.
